<div align="center"> <h2 align="center"> Greetings to the Pizza project. Inside this repositiory, you'll discover a comprehensive analysis of the Pizza dataset. The tool I have used for this project is PowerBI </h2> </div>

<div align="center"> <h3 align="center"> 🎯 Goals 🎯 </h3> </div>
The goal of the Pizza project is to explore the PowerBI application's tools and techniques. This involves cleaning the data using <b><i> PowerQuery (SQL) </i></b> which is a tool within PowerBI and creating visuatations.

<div align="center"> <h3 align="center"> 🔢 Dataset 🔢 </h3> </div>
The dataset used is called "Dataset- pizza_supbrands.xlsx". It consists of 2 tables called 'cheese & tomato' and 'pepperoni'. For this project, I have only used the 'cheese & tomato' table which consists data on the brand, name of the pizza, whether its fresh or frozen, the energy, fat, saturated fat per 100g and salt per 100g details.

<div align="center"> <h3 align="center"> 📂 Repository Sections 📂 </h3> </div>  
- Dataset- pizza_supbrands.xlsx -> this is a CSV file with the Pizza dataset <br>
- Pizza Supbrands.pbix - > this is a PowerBI file which contains the visualisations for this project <br>
